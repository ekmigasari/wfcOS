The WFCOS To-Do List has continuously evolved to offer robust task management capabilities. Here's how its features empower you to stay organized and focused:

- **Track Your Effort with Session Counts**: A unique aspect highlighted is its ability to **"Show session count in task item."** This feature likely integrates with the Timer or Session Log, allowing you to see how many focused work sessions you've dedicated to a specific task. It provides valuable context on effort and helps in planning future work.

- **Flexible Task Management**: You're not locked into static entries. With the ability to **"edit task feature,"** you can easily update task details, correct errors, or refine your objectives as priorities shift. This adaptability is crucial for a dynamic workflow.

- **Organize Your Way with Sorting and Moving**: To further enhance organization, WFCOS has **"Enabled sorting and moving tasks."** This means you can arrange your to-do list according to priority, deadline, project, or any other system that works for you. The flexibility to reorder and group tasks ensures your list always reflects your current focus.

- **Continuous Improvement for Better Management**: The commitment to **"enhanced to-do list with improved task management"** signifies ongoing development to make the tool even more intuitive and powerful, ensuring it meets the demands of users who need to manage multiple tasks and projects effectively.

## Benefits of the Integrated WFCOS To-Do List

Having your to-do list as part of WFCOS offers several advantages:

- **Reduced Context Switching**: Manage your tasks without needing to open a separate application, keeping you focused within your primary workspace.
- **Synergy with Other Tools**: The potential link between tasks and session counts suggests a deeper integration with other productivity modules in WFCOS, like the Timer and Session Log, providing a holistic view of your work.
- **Centralized Task Hub**: Keep all your action items in one place, making it easier to plan your day, week, or longer-term projects.

## Take Control of Your Tasks

The WFCOS To-Do List is designed to be a dynamic and integral part of your productivity toolkit. By offering features that go beyond basic list-making, it helps you not just list what you need to do, but actively manage, prioritize, and track your progress towards accomplishing your goals.
