## The Challenge: Crafting Excellence with Next.js

Developers worldwide were invited to push their creative and technical limits, focusing on three core pillars that define cutting-edge web applications today:

- **Highest Quality**: This wasn't just about aesthetics; it was a call for robust, well-architected applications with impeccable user experience from the first click.
- **Fastest App**: In an era of fleeting attention spans, participants vied to build applications that load instantaneously and perform with unmatched efficiency.
- **Best Use of AI**: Beyond buzzwords, this category challenged developers to integrate AI meaningfully, creating tangible value and innovative functionalities.

## From Code to Crown: Celebrating the Winning Teams

The energy was palpable as the winners were announced, each project a narrative of late-night coding sessions, collaborative problem-solving, and a passion for pushing Next.js to its fullest potential.

### The Grand Champion: Text0 - AI-Powered Writing, Perfected

**Text0** didn't just win; it set a new benchmark. This AI writing assistant, lauded for its stellar design, peak performance, and user-centric approach, earned its team the grand prize: a trip to San Francisco. Text0 also received the **Best Use of AI** award, serving as an inspiring example of how to meld complex AI capabilities with the fluid development experience of Next.js to create something truly special.

### Highest Quality App: Work From Coffee OS - Engineering the Future of Remote Productivity

### Fastest App: gitfaster - Where Speed Meets Substance

**gitfaster** demonstrated that performance is not an afterthought but a core feature. Winning the **Fastest App** category, it highlighted how Next.js, with its advanced optimization features, can be leveraged to build applications that respond with breathtaking speed, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.

## The Ecosystem Effect: Partners Fueling Innovation

A hackathon of this scale thrives on a strong support system. The Next.js Global Hackathon 2025 was backed by an impressive roster of technology leaders whose tools and platforms empower developers to build without limits. Our sincere appreciation goes to:

Anthropic, Browserbase, Clerk, Convex, Cursor, Eleven Labs, Fal, Gemini, Groq, Langbase, Luma, Neon, OpenAI, Polar, Replicate, Resend, Scrapybara, Sentry, Supabase, Tinybird, Upstash, Windsurf, and xAI.

This collaboration between framework maintainers, infrastructure providers, and AI innovators creates a fertile ground for the entire developer community to learn, grow, and build amazing things.

## More Than Just a Competition: A Catalyst for Growth

The Next.js Global Hackathon is a powerful reminder of what developers can achieve when equipped with great tools and a shared purpose. It's a platform for learning new skills, experimenting with cutting-edge technologies (like the latest React 19 features often previewed with Next.js), and connecting with a global network of peers.

The ripple effects of this event will be seen in new open-source contributions, innovative startup ideas, and an inspired community eager to build the next wave of web applications. We applaud every single participant for their dedication and creativity. The future of the web is in capable hands!
